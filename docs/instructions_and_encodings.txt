Note that register pairs are fixed to have their high byte stored in a
register rX and their low byte stored in another register r(X + 1) such
that X is an even number.  

Here are some example register pairs:  r0p (high byte r0, low byte r1), 
  r2p (high byte r2, low byte r3), r4p (high byte r4, low byte r5), etc.


Special register pairs:  
  1)  The program counter's two bytes are stored in the register pair
  r14p.  If there is ever an assembler for this CPU, "pc" (without
  quotes) will be an alias for "r14p" (without quotes).
  2)  The link register's two bytes are stored in the register pair r12p
  (enforced by the hardware, but only relevant to the call and calli
  instructions).  If there is ever an assembler for this CPU, "lr" (without
  quotes) will be an alias for "r12p" (without quotes).
  3)  As an ASSEMBLER CONVENTION, the stack pointer's two bytes are stored
  in the register pair r10p.  If there is ever an assembler for this
  CPU, "sp" (without quotes) will be an alias for "r10p" (without
  quotes).
