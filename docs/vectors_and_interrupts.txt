-- VECTORS AND INTERRUPTS --

There are two hardcoded vectors for where code should start for two
different situations.

Each vector consists of a big-endian, 16-bit address, which specifies what
address the PC will be set to.


Address 0x8000 (hexadecimal):  Reset Vector.  The CPU jumps here at the
start the program.

Address 0x8002 (hexadecimal):  Interrupt Vector.  The CPU jumps here when
an interrupt happens.


INTERRUPT PROCESS

When the CPU begins executing an interrupt, it disables interrupts during
the same process.  

In the best case (that is, when the CPU doesn't have to wait for memory),
the CPU uses only one cycle to change the PC to the interrupt vector and
simultaneously disable interrupts.  Also, simultaneously, the old PC is
stored in a special register called the Interrupt Return Address (IRA for
short).  The "reti" instruction copies the IRA to the PC and enables
interrupts.  There are a few other instructions that can be use to
manipulate the IRA.  

There is not a true "in an interrupt" mode of the CPU.  It is simply
implied that the CPU is in interrupts mode if the CPU is executing the
interrupt service routine.


No registers OR FLAGS are pushed to the stack automatically upon beginning
an interrupt (especially since there is no hardware-enforced stack 
pointer), so the interrupt routine should do that if it is so desired.

There are no extra registers OR FLAGS for dealing with interrupts more
quickly, which is a bit of a weakness of the CPU, though it did make the
hardware implementation of interrupts extremely simple.  I MAY add another
set of registers AND FLAGS in a future revision of Jolt80.
