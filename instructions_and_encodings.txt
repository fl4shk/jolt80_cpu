Note that register pairs are fixed to have their high byte stored in a
register rX and their low byte stored in another register r(X + 1) such
that X is an even number.  

Here are some example register pairs:  r0:r1, r2:r3, r4:r5, etc.


Special register pairs:  
  1)  The program counter's two bytes are stored in the register pair
  r14:r15.  If there is ever an assembler for this CPU, "pc" (without
  quotes) will be an alias for "r14:r15" (without quotes).
  2)  As an ASSEMBLER CONVENTION, the stack pointer's two bytes are stored
  in the register pair r12:r13.  If there is ever an assembler for this
  CPU, "sp" (without quotes) will be an alias for "r12:r13" (without
  quotes).
  3)  As an ASSEMBLER CONVENTION, the link register's two bytes are stored
  in the register pair r10:r11.  If there is ever an assembler for this
  CPU, "lr" (without quotes) will be an alias for "r10:r11" (without
  quotes).



Instruction encodings:

Type 1:  0ooo aaaa iiii iiii
  Encoding description:  op (o); rA (a); immediate value (i)
  Instructions:  
    Arithmetic instructions:  
      addi, adci, subi (ASSEMBLER ALIAS for addi with the negative of the
      immediate value), sbci (ASSEMBLER ALIAS for adci with the negative of
      the immediate value), cmpi
    Copy instructions:  
      cpyi (CoPY Immediate)

Type 2:  10oo oooo aaaa bbbb
  Encoding description:  op (o); rA (a); rB (b)
  Instructions:  
    Arithmetic instructions:  
      add, adc, sub, sbc, cmp,
    Bitwise instructions with two register operands:  
      and, orr, xor, 
    Bitshifting (and rotating) instructions that use the value of (rB % 8)
    as the number of bits to shift by:
      lsl, lsr, asr, rol, ror
    Copy instructions:
      cpy (CoPY from one register to another register)

Type 3:  110o oooo aaaa Dbbb
  Encoding description:  op (o); rA (a); 
    reg pair starting with (bbb << 1) (b); don't care (D)
  Instructions:  
    Load/store instructions:
      ldr (LoaD contents into Register rA from memory), 
      str (STore Register rA contents to memory),

Type 4:  1110 oooo Daaa Dbbb
  Encoding description:  op (o); reg pair starting with (aaa << 1) (a); 
    reg pair starting with (bbb << 1) (b); don't care (D)
  Instructions:  
    Swap instructions:  
      swp (SWap register Pair, also used as a combined "call" and "jump"
      instruction by swapping some other register pair with the "pc"
      (r14:r15) register pair)

Type 5:  1111 oooo iiii iiii
  Encoding description:  op (o); immediate value (i)
    Branching instructions (note that iiii iiii is a SIGNED 8-bit integer):
      bra (branch always), bnv (branch never, a form of NOP)
      bne (branch when Z == 0), beq (branch when Z == 1), 
      bcc (branch when C == 0), bcs (branch when C == 1)
